    <h2>About SmartFinance</h2>

    <p>
      SmartFinance is a financial management platform designed to help
      households and small businesses understand, control, and improve
      their financial health.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people and businesses struggle not because they lack income,
      but because they lack clarity. SmartFinance focuses on turning
      everyday financial data into clear insights that support better
      decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      For households, the platform helps track income, expenses, budgets,
      bills, assets, and liabilities. For businesses, it focuses on the
      three core financial statements: the Income Statement, Cash Flow
      Statement, and Balance Sheet.
    </p>

    <p>
      By combining accounting principles with modern technology and
      automation, SmartFinance aims to make financial management simple,
      practical, and accessible.
